              Milk chocolate is a solid chocolate confectionery containing
              cocoa, sugar and milk. It is the most consumed type of chocolate.
              Chocolate was originally sold and consumed as a beverage in
              pre-Columbian times. Although four-fifths of all milk chocolate is
              sold in the United States and Europe, increasingly large amounts
              are consumed in China and Latin America.
